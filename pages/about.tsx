						On the 8th of March 2024 I participated in Encode Club's 3 day AI
						Hackathon event, as the first hackathon I've taken part in. With the
						help of my two teammates, we won the bounty for "Most promising AI x
						Crypto Build" with a AI generated, text-based game generator called
						AI Adventure World. It was a lot of fun and will be looking for more
						hackathons to join in the future.
