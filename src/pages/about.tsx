						My experience covers several programming languages but the ones I am
						most comfortable with are TypeScript and Python, as I have used them
						the most in building full-stack applications with React, Node.js and
						Flask. I also have experience with data science and machine learning
						technologies like NumPy, pandas and Scikit-Learn, as well as DevOps
						tools like Docker, Ansible, and Git CI/CD pipelines. Please take a

						During lockdown in 2020, I developed a regular running routine,
						aspiring to one day complete an ultramarathon (&#8805;50km). On the
						22nd of October 2023, I ran the Battersea Park Marathon and raised
						Â£275 for The Alzheimer's Society! To explore my running stats, click{' '}

						On the 8th of March 2024 I participated in Encode Club's 3 day AI
						Hackathon event, as the first hackathon I've taken part in. With the
						help of my two teammates, we won the bounty for "Most promising AI x
						Crypto Build" with a AI generated, text-based game generator called
						AI Adventure World. It was a lot of fun and will be looking for more
						hackathons to join in the future.
