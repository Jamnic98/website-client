				<h2>Hackathon Win</h2>
				<p>
					On the 8th of March 2024 I participated in the largest A.I Hackathon event in London.
					It was a a 3 day event, held by Encode Club and hundreds of applicants participated. 
					As the first hackathon I&apos;ve taken part in but with the help of my two teammates, 
					we won the bounty for &quot;Most promising AI x Crypto Build&quot;
					with a AI generated, text-based game generator called AI Adventure World. 
					It was a lot of fun and will be looking for more hackathons to join in the future!
				</p>

					Since 2020, I have cultivated a regular running routine,
					aspiring to one day complete an ultramarathon (&#8805;50km).

				On the
					22nd of October 2023, I ran the Battersea Park Marathon and raised
