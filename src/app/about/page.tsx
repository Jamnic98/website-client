				<h2>Coding Experience</h2>
				<p>
					TypeScript and Python are the languages I am most experienced with,

					performant and scalable web applications. 
					Building full-stack applications with React, Node.js and
					Flask. I also have experience with data science and machine learning
					technologies like NumPy, pandas and Scikit-Learn, as well as DevOps
					tools like Docker, Ansible, and Git CI/CD pipelines. 
					These skills I aquired through a combination of self-study, 
					online courses and working commercially as a Software Developer.

				<h2>Hackathon Win</h2>
				<p>
					{/* TODO: FIX! */}
					On the 8th of March 2024 I participated in the largest A.I Hackathon event in London.
					It was a a 3 day event, held by Encode Club and hundreds of applicants. 
					As the first hackathon I&apos;ve taken part in. 
					With the help of my two teammates, we won the bounty for &quot;Most promising AI x Crypto Build&quot;
					with a AI generated, text-based game generator called AI Adventure World. 
					It was a lot of fun and will be looking for more hackathons to join in the future.
				</p>
				<h2>Running and Marathon</h2>
				<p>
					Since 2020, I have cultivated a regular running routine,
					aspiring to one day complete an ultramarathon (&#8805;50km).
				</p>
				<p>
				On the
					22nd of October 2023, I ran the Battersea Park Marathon and raised
					Â£275 for The Alzheimer&apos;s Society! To explore my running stats,
