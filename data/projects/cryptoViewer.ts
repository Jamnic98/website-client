		`Around the start of August 2021, I became interested in cryptocurrency investing and wanted to monitor the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum
     without having to continually check online, so I built a circuit with some electronic components and programmed a NodeMCU ESP-12 wifi 
     enabled micro-controller using C++ to request cryptocurrency prices in GBP from Coinbase. To display the prices, I initially connected
     a 2.2 inch TFT display, which worked well, as multiple prices could be displayed at once. Unfortunately, after about a month of use, one
     of the components on the board which controlled the display blew, so I replaced it with the only other screen I had at the time, which was
     a 16x2 LCD screen. To display more than two cryptocurrencies at a time, I coded the ESP-12 to cycle through the price strings, giving them
     the appearance of being shifted upwards incrementally.
