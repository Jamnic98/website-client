     renew all the books which are due. The idea came to me when I made a joke/bet with my sister that I could write
     a program to renew the books I had loaned from the library. Currently, I have a Raspberry Pi running the program daily with
     cron to check if there are any books due. The program also sends a confirmation email relaying information
     about which books were renewed.`,
